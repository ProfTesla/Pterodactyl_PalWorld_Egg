An egg I based off the L4D2 egg, mostly for its Docker Image, and then modified to run PalWorld by copying over the 64bit Steam Library. 
Running fine on Pterodactyl 1.11.3

The config file palworldsettings.ini in /Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer gets overridden at start, so, I set the variables after copying from the default template, and change permissions to 444.
